- 👋 Hi, I’m Darlene Tandang, a part-time graduate student currently enrolled in the program Master of Science in Geomatics Engineering major in Geoinformatics at the University of the Philippines Diliman. My graduation target year is 2025.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills, specifically Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), Python, Web mapping, and big data analytics, and turning these learnings into Public Policy.
- 🌱 I have been a development worker focusing on planning, monitoring, and evaluating development plans at national and local levels for almost three years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and international journals related to spatial information, renewable energy, Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Change, Governance, and Public policy.
